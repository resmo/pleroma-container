# Pleroma

[Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) is a federated social networking platform, compatible with GNU social and other OStatus implementations. It is free software licensed under the AGPLv3.

## Usage

### Installation

Copy and modify `docker-compose.yml`

```
docker-compose up
```

## Why

This project is based on and inspired by https://github.com/angristan/docker-pleroma. However I wanted to have a minimal container image without build utilities in it.
